    How is Asian fried chicken different?
    Asians love texture to a fault; it’s just a fact. I have a running joke that if I ask Steph how good a Chinese restaurant is, she will only describe their textures, like “they make really crispy fried chicken” or “they have really chewy noodles”. It’s taken for granted that the food tastes good.

    So likewise with the wings, Asian fried chicken emphasizes texture. Sometimes this means crisp shattering crunch, but sometimes it also means “used to be crunchy but now saucy”. You have to taste it to understand that one.

    How to make the best fried chicken
Almost all Asian fried chickens are made the same way. The chicken is marinated first, if it’s not being coated in a sauce. Then it’s dredged in a flour or starch coating, then fried, then sauced while hot or dusted with spices, if needed. It doesn’t matter if it’s korean fried chicken or thai fish sauce wings, the basic steps are the same
